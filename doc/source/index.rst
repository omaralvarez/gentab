**GenTab** documentation
========================

**GenTab**: Synthetic Tabular Data Generation Library
-----------------------------------------------------

**GenTab** is a Python library dedicated to the generation of synthetic tabular data. It integrates a comprehensive suite of statistical, Machine Learning (ML) and Deep Learning (DL) methods to accurately capture the underlying patterns in real datasets and replicate them in synthetic form. The library is designed for applications such as dataset pre-processing, data balancing and resampling, facilitating rigorous analysis and experimentation in contexts where data availability or diversity may be limited.
